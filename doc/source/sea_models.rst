SEA models
----------

In Statistical Energy Analysis the vibroacoustic system is modelled as systems of coupled reverberant wave fields 
that exchange energy. The method is described in in [Lyo1995]_ and [Pei2022]_ in detail or briefly in `SEA introduction <https://docpeiffer.com/statistical-energy-analysis-sea/>`_.
For the set-up of such models the database must be populated with system properties namely the geometry, the property determining
the wave motion, the coupling physics and the sources.

Two rooms separated by a wall
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This building acoustic example deals with two rooms that are separated by a concrete wall.
The configuration is shown in figure :ref:`fig-two-rooms`.  

.. _fig-two-rooms:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   
   Two rooms separated by a concrete wall.
   
We start with the material properties and use typical data for air and light concrete::

    h        = 0.05           # wall thickness
    air      = matC.Fluid()   # default air
    concrete = matC.IsoMat(E=3.8e9,nu=0.33,rho0=1250.)
    
The wall has thickness 5 cm thus::

    concrete_5cm    = stPC.PlateProp(h,concrete)
    
Due to the fact that the setup is rectangular we use the rectangular versions of system description::

    # wall dimensions
    Ly = 4.
    Lz = 2.5
    S  = Lz*Ly

    # Additional room dimensions
    Lx1 = 3.
    Lx2 = 5.
    # Absorption area
    As1  = 8.
    As2  = 10.
    
    wall  = st2Dsys.RectangularPlate(2, Ly,Lz,prop=concrete_5cm, eta = 0.03)
    room1 = ac3Dsys.RectangularRoom(1, Lx1, Ly, Lz, air, absorption_area = As1, damping_type= ['surface'])
    room2 = ac3Dsys.RectangularRoom(3, Lx2, Ly, Lz, air, absorption_area = As2, damping_type= ['surface'])

The ``damping_type`` argument assures that the air damping is not used but only damping from surface absorption.
The logical next step is to couple all systems by an :class:`~pyva.coupling.junctions.AreaJunction`. 
If no area argument is given the coupling surface defaults to the surface of the wall::

    J123 = con.AreaJunction((room1,wall,room2))
    
The centre system must be the wall if three systems are involved. 

In addition, the frequency range must be defined. This is usually a third-octave
band spectrum in SEA and building acoustics. ::

    omega = mC.DataAxis.octave_band(f_max=2*np.pi*10000)
    
Helper variables are created in addition for easier plotting of the frequency axis in Hertz::

    om    = omega.data
    freq  = om/2/np.pi 
    
One source is assumed to introduce power into the first room. 
This load is defined by::
    
    pow_dof     = dof.DOF(1,0,dof.DOFtype(typestr = 'power'))
    power1mWatt = lC.Load(omega, 0.001*np.ones(omega.shape), pow_dof, name = '1mWatt')
    
We have collected all input to create the model using the :class:`~pyva.models.HybridModel` class but without FEM systems included ::

    two_rooms = mds.HybridModel((wall,room1,room2),xdata=omega)
    two_rooms.add_junction({'areaJ_12':J123})
    two_rooms.add_load('1mWatt',power1mWatt)

and solve it::

    two_rooms.create_SEA_matrix()
    two_rooms.solve()
    
The next step is to work with the model, query some details and access the result.
We start with the evaluation of the random properties and take a deeper look on the modal density ::

    plt.plot(freq,wall.modal_density(om,3),label = 'wall')
    plt.plot(freq,wall.modal_density(om,5),label = 'wall')
    plt.plot(freq,room1.modal_density(om),label = 'room1')
    plt.plot(freq,room2.modal_density(om),label = 'room2')
    
With the following result:

.. _fig-two-rooms-modal-density:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_modal_density.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Modal density of SEA systems.
   
Of further importance is the modal overlap::

    plt.plot(freq,wall.modal_overlap(om,3),label = 'wall') ...
    plt.plot(freq,wall.modal_overlap(om,5),label = 'wall') ...
    plt.plot(freq,room1.modal_overlap(om),label = 'room1')
    plt.plot(freq,room2.modal_overlap(om),label = 'room2')
    
leading to:

.. _fig-two-rooms-modal-overlap:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_modal_overlap.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Modal overlap of SEA systems.

Note that the modal overlap is larger than 1 for all frequencies, except 
for the combined in plane waves (LS). Due to their high sound speed the 
modal overlap becomes high enough above 1kHz.

For better understanding of the coupling dynamics it is helpful to investigate the radiation 
physics of the wall. The coincidence frequency is a method of the 
:class:`~pyva.properties.structuralPropertyClasses.PlateProp` class::

    f_c = concrete_5cm.coincidence_frequency(air.c0)/2/np.pi
    >>> f_c
    702.353
    
So, this wall will have critical sound isolation properties at 700 Hz (which is not a good design for buildings).
For the wall system we can derive the radiation efficiency in two ways::

    sigma        = wall.radiation_efficiency(om,fluid = air)
    sigma_simple = wall.radiation_efficiency_simple(om,fluid = air)
    
The first method uses Leppingtons simplified approach [Lep1982]_ averaged over the quarter wavenumber circle,
the second method is an implementation of the ISO EN 12354-1.

.. _fig-two-rooms-radiation-efficieny:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_radiation_efficiency.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Radiation efficiency of the wall derived by different methods.
   
Both methods agree well except in the coincidence peak. See [Pei2022]_ for details of the implementation.

Next, the SEA results are investigated in detail. In general the result of each [All2009]s are of class :class:`~pyva.data.matrixClasses.Signal`.
The solution generate results in the energy and result attribute :

    >>> two_rooms.energy
    Signal object of 17 samples with 4 channels and properties ...
    DataAxis of 17 samples and type angular frequency in 1 / second
    DOF object with ID [2 2 1 3], DOF [3 5 0 0] of type [energy in joule]    

Thus the methods from the Signal class can be used for plotting and further query.
Starting with the energy of each system / wavefield::

    two_rooms.energy.plot(20,xscale = 'log',yscale = 'log',ls = ['-','--',':','-.'],
            fulllegstr = ('wall B','wall LS','room1','room2'))

.. _fig-two-rooms-radiation-energy:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_energy.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Energy of subsystems.

Note that there is no energy in the LS wavefield because it is not coupled to the room acoustic wave field. 

For, all systems the engineering unit was also calculated automatically::

    >>> two_rooms.result
    Signal object of 17 samples with 4 channels and properties ...
    DataAxis of 17 samples and type angular frequency in 1 / second
    DOF object with ID [2 2 1 3], DOF [3 5 0 0] of type [velocity in meter / second, velocity in meter / second, pressure in pascal, pressure in pascal]   
    
.. _fig-two-rooms-velocity:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_velocity.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Velocity of the wall.

.. _fig-two-rooms-pressure:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_pressure.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Pressure of the rooms.
   
For the determination of the acoustic performance of the wall we calculate the transmission loss.
Because of :math:`As1 = S` [Pei2022]_ the transmission coefficient can be calculated directly from the 
pressure ratio of both rooms. ::

    p1 = two_rooms.result[2].ydata.flatten()
    p2 = two_rooms.result[3].ydata.flatten()
    tau = (p2/p1)**2 
    TL = -10*np.log10(tau)
    
The transmission loss in figure :ref:`fig-two-rooms-TL` clearly reveals the coincidence dip.

.. _fig-two-rooms-TL:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_TL.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Transmission loss of the wall
   
Further insight is provided when the power inputs to room2 are calculated, revealling
that the power radiated from the wall is dominating over a large frequency range ::

    pow_in_room1 = two_rooms.power_input(3)
 
.. _fig-two-rooms-power-in:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_power_in.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Power input to room 2 
   
Two rooms with floor separated by a wall
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The first case is a pure airborne transmission case. 
A more realistic example is created by adding a floor to both rooms.

.. _fig-two-rooms-floor:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_floor.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   
   Two rooms separated by a concrete wall plus floor plates. 
   
The floor is supposed to have higher thickness than the wall ::

    concrete_17cm  = stPC.PlateProp(h_f,concrete)

and the floor subsystems have ``ID=4`` and ``5`` ::

    floor1 = st2Dsys.RectangularPlate(4, Lx1,Ly,prop=concrete_17cm, eta = 0.03)
    floor2 = st2Dsys.RectangularPlate(5, Lx2,Ly,prop=concrete_17cm, eta = 0.03)
    
Both floor are connected to the rooms by area junctions ::

    J14  = con.AreaJunction((room1,floor1))
    J35  = con.AreaJunction((room2,floor2))

The 'T'-connection of both floor plates and the wall is a :class:`~pyva.coupling.junctions.LineJunction` of length Ly ::

    J425 = con.LineJunction((floor1,wall,floor2),length = Ly, thetas = (0,90,180))
    
Instead of the power source in room1 a force excitation at floor1 is used ::

    force10Nrms = lC.Load(omega, 10*np.ones(omega.shape), dof.DOF(4,3,dof.DOFtype(typestr = 'force')), name = '10N')
    
The DOF instance determines the excitation at system ID=4 (floor1) and wave_DOF=3 (bending).
The model is created by ::

    omega = mC.DataAxis.octave_band(f_min=2*np.pi*50,f_max=2*np.pi*10000)

    two_rooms = mds.HybridModel((wall,room1,room2,floor1,floor2),xdata=omega)
    
with the junctions and load defined by ::

    two_rooms.add_junction({'areaJ_123':J123})
    two_rooms.add_junction({'areaJ_14':J14})
    two_rooms.add_junction({'areaJ_35':J35})
    two_rooms.add_junction({'lineJ_425':J425})

    two_rooms.add_load('10N',force10Nrms)# add force excitatio to wave_DOF 3 of system 4
    
The frequency starts at 50Hz for illustrating some typical checks in SEA [All2009].
Before, we solve the model we perform these typical checks. This time the modes in band of the plate systems are shown in 
the following figure:

.. _fig-two-rooms-floor-modes-in-band:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_floor_modes_in_band.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Modes in band of plate subsystems.
   
One rule of thumb of SEA is, that a subsystem should have at least 5 modes in band. This is the case 
for all subsystems above 400 Hz. Results at lower frequencies should be considered as not very precise.
However, due to higher thickness of the floor the coincidence frequency is lower than for the wall ::

    f_cf = concrete_17cm.coincidence_frequency(air.c0)/2/np.pi
    >>> f_cf
    206.57440
    
So, the coincidence frequency is at 200 Hz and the floor plates will be good radiators for the 
full SEA frequency range. The radiation efficiency of both floor plates is shown in the following figure:

.. _fig-two-rooms-floor-radiation-efficiency:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_floor_radiation_efficiency.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
   Radiation efficiency of floor plates.
   
The force excitation on floor 1 radiates acoustic power into all wave field. the line junction transfers
energy from the bending wave field into the in-plane (LS) wave field.

.. _fig-two-rooms-floor-energy:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_floor_energy.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   
Energy of subsystem wave field due to 10N rms excitation. When converted into the engineering results. 
the pressure and velocity results read as follows:

.. _fig-two-rooms-floor-pressure:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_floor_pressure.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
 
   Pressure result of rooms. 
 
.. _fig-two-rooms-floor-velocity:
    
.. figure:: ./images/two_rooms_floor_velocity.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70% 
   
   Bending wave field velocity.
   
The pressure in room 1 shows  a coincidence peak at the floor coincidence. So the floor1 is the main
radiator for room 1. Room 2 has the coincidence peak at wall coincidence. 
In order to determine the dominant path we apply the :meth:`pyva.models.HybridModel.power_input` method::

    pow_in_room1.plot(32,yscale = 'log',xscale = 'log')
    pow_in_room2.plot(32,yscale = 'log',xscale = 'log')
    
The curves in figure :ref:`fig-two-rooms-floor-pow-in-room1` reveal that the main power input comes from the radiating
floor1 and wall that has received acoustic energy from the line junction. In figure :ref:`fig-two-rooms-floor-pow-in-room2`
the situation is different. Here, the wall bending wave is the main source of energy followed by the floor 2 wave.
Non resonant air transmission from room 1 contributes least.

.. _sec-box-cover:

Box cover of sound source
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The next example shows an application of box structures for sound isolation. 
In addition it is an application of the :class:`~pyva.coupling.junction.SemiInfiniteFluid` class of the junctions module 
and it illustrates
the limit of text based model description. Due to the large number of junction and systems
even for such a simple box it becomes clear that for later complex model applications a GUI and 
a 3D representation of the models will be mandatory.

The set-up is shown in the following figure

.. _fig-SEA_box:
    
.. figure:: ./images/SEA_box.*
   :align: center
   :width: 50% 
   
   SEA model of box covering a power source
   
First, we define the frequency range and the box dimensions::

    # Frequency range
    omega = mC.DataAxis.octave_band(f_max=2*np.pi*10000)

    # Plate dimensions
    Lx = 1.2
    Ly = 1
    Lz = 1.1

    # Box dimensions
    V = Lx*Ly*Lz
    A = 2*(Lx*Ly+Ly*Lz+Lx*Lz)
    P = 4*(Lx+Ly+Lz)

    # Plates thickness
    t = 2.0E-3;

    # junction angle
    angle_R = (0.,90*np.pi/180)

and the materials and properties ::

    # Create materials
    steel = matC.IsoMat(E=210e9,nu=0.3,rho0=7800, eta = 0.0)
    air   = matC.Fluid() 

    # Create props
    steel2mm = stPC.PlateProp(t,steel)

Next step is the creation of the subsystems ::

    # Create plate subsystems
    plate1 = st2Dsys.RectangularPlate(1,Lx,Lz,prop = steel2mm)
    plate2 = st2Dsys.RectangularPlate(2,Ly,Lz,prop = steel2mm)
    plate3 = st2Dsys.RectangularPlate(3,Lx,Lz,prop = steel2mm)
    plate4 = st2Dsys.RectangularPlate(4,Ly,Lz,prop = steel2mm)
    plate5 = st2Dsys.RectangularPlate(5,Lx,Ly,prop = steel2mm)

    room     = ac3Dsys.Acoustic3DSystem(6, V , A, P, air)
    
The box is emerged in free space and requires semi infinite fluid (SIF) to allow free space radiation.
SIFs are created by a list of connected subsystems (where the connection can be resonant and non-resonant) 
and the fluid into which the radiation takes place. ::

    # create semi infinite fluids
    sif1 = jun.SemiInfiniteFluid((room,plate1), air)
    sif2 = jun.SemiInfiniteFluid((room,plate2), air)
    ...
    
All junctions are here created as dictionary from scratch. ::

    juncs =  { 'j61' : jun.AreaJunction((room,plate1)), 
               'j62' : jun.AreaJunction((room,plate2)),
               ...
               'j12' : jun.LineJunction((plate1,plate2), Lz, angle_R),
               'j23' : jun.LineJunction((plate2,plate3), Lz, angle_R),
                ... }
                
Not to forget the power source in the room (ID = 6) ::

    power1W = lC.Load(omega, np.ones(omega.shape), dof.DOF(6,0,dof.DOFtype(typestr = 'power')), name = '1Watt')
    
Finally we create the model and put things together ::

    #create SEA model
    box = mds.HybridModel((plate1,plate2,plate3,plate4,plate5,room),xdata=omega)

    #connect all
    box.add_junction(juncs)
    box.add_SIF({'sif1' : sif1, 
                 'sif2' : sif2, 
                 'sif3' : sif3, 
                 'sif4' : sif4, 
                 'sif5' : sif5})
                 
    box.add_load('1Watt',power1Watt) # add 1Watt per band 
    
and solve it ::

    box.create_SEA_matrix(sym = 1)
    box.solve()
    
The interesting feature here is how much of the power is removed from the source. With the 
:meth:`pyva.models.HybridModel.power_input` method, we get the power inputs into the SIFs ::

    sif1_in = box.power_input('sif1')
    sif2_in = box.power_input('sif2')
    sif3_in = box.power_input('sif3')
    sif4_in = box.power_input('sif4')
    sif5_in = box.power_input('sif5')

Plotting the result for example for SIF1 we see the non-resonant (ID=6) and resonant (ID=3) power radiation to the free 
space.  
  
.. _fig-SEA_box_pure_SIF_power_in:
    
.. figure:: ./images/box_pure_SIF_power_in.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70% 
   
   Input power to SIF1
   
All values are added by using the :meth:`~pyva.data.matrixClasses.Signal.sum` method of :class:`~pyva.data.matrixClasses.Signal` 
that add all those paths in one signal and adding all SIF contributions::

    sif_all = sif1_in.sum()+sif2_in.sum()+sif3_in.sum()+sif4_in.sum()+sif5_in.sum()
    
This leads to the total source level

.. _fig-SEA_box_pure_SIF_total:
    
.. figure:: ./images/box_pure_SIF_total.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70% 
   
   Total input power to all SIFs
   
Note that 1Watt corresponds to Lw=120 dB, so noise reduction is not perfect. 
    
Box cover with noise control treatment
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Typical noise control strategy would start at the source. Let's say that this is not possible here, 
so the next step is first to bring absorption into the cavity and second to increase the isolation by an extra treatment.
The configuration from the last section a) and this one b) is shown in the following figure. 

   
.. _fig-SEA_box_configurations:
    
.. figure:: ./images/SEA_box_configurations.*
   :align: center
   :width: 50% 
   
   Pure and trimmed configuration
    
We create the additional materials and properties for the treatment ::

    import pyva.systems.infiniteLayers as iL

    # Fibre material
    rho_bulk = 0.98*1.20 + 30.
    fibre1 = matC.EquivalentFluid(porosity = 0.98, \
                                   flow_res = 25000.,\
                                   tortuosity = 1.02, \
                                   length_visc = 90.e-6, \
                                   length_therm = 180.e-6,\
                                   rho_bulk = rho_bulk , \
                                   rho0 = 1.208, \
                                   dynamic_viscosity = 1.81e-5 )

    # Thickness of fibre layer
    h1 = 0.05
    
From those properties, infinite layer are created ::

    fibre_5cm = iL.FluidLayer(h1,fibre1)
    heavy_1kg = iL.MassLayer(0.001, 1000)
    
The treatments are defined via the TMmodel class ::

    nct_mass     = mds.TMmodel((fibre_5cm,heavy_1kg)) 
    nct          = mds.TMmodel((fibre_5cm,)) 

As the absorption is always determined at the (left) layer interface, we must reverse the treatment for
the absorption determination ::

    nct_mass4abs = mds.TMmodel((heavy_1kg,fibre_5cm))

For the box cavity absorption we use the absorption_diffuse method ::

    # absorption due to trim
    alpha_nct      = nct.absorption_diffuse(om,in_fluid=air)
    alpha_nct_mass = nct_mass4abs.absorption_diffuse(om,in_fluid=air)

The ``abs_area`` is created from the specifically treated areas ::
    
    abs_area = alpha_nct*(Lx*Ly)+alpha_nct_mass*(A-Lx*Ly)
    # This is a signal those dof must be set to the area DOF
    abs_area.dof = area_dof 
    
The absorption area is not constant and therefore a Signal::

    abs_area.plot(1,xscale = 'log')
    
This leads to a figure that shows that at high frequencies the absorption at the floor plate area of 1.2m^2 is dominant. 

.. _fig-SEA_box_isolated_abs_area:
    
.. figure:: ./images/box_isolated_abs_area.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70% 
   
   Absorption area due to NCT
   
To make the NCT working we add it to the plate systems and the absorption area to the room ::

    # Create plate subsystems
    plate1 = st2Dsys.RectangularPlate(1,Lx,Lz,prop = steel2mm,trim=(nct_mass,'none'))

The value to the ``damping_type`` keyword parameter tells pyva that both damping effects are used.
This adds the absorption to the cavity and increases the isolation due to the mass-spring treatment leading
to a much higher isolation and lower sound power levels.
